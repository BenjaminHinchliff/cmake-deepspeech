# Cmake Deepspeech STT

An example of using cmake with Mozilla's deepspeech STT speech recognition of .wav files (with the help of the fantastic [audiofile](https://github.com/adamstark/AudioFile) library)

**note for cloning** this project uses git lfs for and shard object and model files, and so you'll need to keep this in mind while cloning it.

## Usage

There are no precompiled binaries due to how the project builds, sorry about that.

## Compilation

standard cmake config - will build for Windows, Linux, and (hopefully) Mac OSX (not tested) by automatically switching the so files.
